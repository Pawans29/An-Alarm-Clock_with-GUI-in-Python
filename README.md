⏰ # An-Alarm-Clock_with-GUI-in-Python   
A simple alarm clock with a GUI creted using tkinter  

📄 About Tkinter- 
   Tkinter module belongs to a standard library of GUI in Python. It helps us to create a dialog box with any information that we want to provide or get from the users.

💻I have created simple functions that take the input in Hrs:mins:second format and starts the clock, as soon as the se time is as as teh current time, it gives you the alarm.
🎃 Just to add some fun element, I have a added the local railway announcements that you can hear on Indian Railway stations 🚝 💥

So The Next time you take your nap, you can use this alarm clock and never miss a beat...
